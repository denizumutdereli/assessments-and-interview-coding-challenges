# assessments-and-interview-coding-challenges
Here I will post and keep update the assessment and interview coding challenges


> Almost every company invites developers to assesments and the interview coding challenges. 

> For my opinion, most of these questions are not related with the real world apps and its modules.

> Once a time I am experienced with a 2 minute coding challenge (adaface - stay away from this site). Unbelieveble but they were asking me to read and write code under 2minutes.

> A few kids say they built a test site, and they convince HR departments that it's a good method. This is definitely not true.

> Developers are rare and the mind behind a developer works different. 

> If you are considering to hire a developer the first think that you have to look the learning-curve. Not to the stress test. 

> Other sites looks not great but fine.

> I will try to keep here update as possible.
